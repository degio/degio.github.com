		<h3>Project OMC</h3>
		<h4>Status: In Progress</h4>
		<p>This project is my attempt at making my own version of a pergola that is adjustable to various needs with zero 
		maintenance. The original plan involved a non-removable top made out of canvas and held down with stainless steel hardware.
		I also wanted it to be very sturdy with little or no wobble in the posts. Everything that Home Depot and Lowe's had was 
		either too ugly or just not sturdy enough. My only choice was to make something from scratch.</p>
		<p>The total cost for this project was very low at under $250. I can't provide an exact figure because I bought more screws
		than I actually needed to build it. Buying them in bulk was cheaper and I now have extra screws for future projects. I also have
		some Spar Varnish and UV/sealer left over for future use.</p>

			<h3>Mmmmm Stainless Steel...</h3>
			<p>The most expensive part of this project was all of the stainless steel involved. I don't live near the ocean so
			rust was not an issue. Well sort of... For some reason, Hot-dip Galvanized fasteners start rusting within one 
			year in my backyard. I am actually conducting a test right now and the screws I placed out there are starting to rust 
			after only 9 months! I didn't want my footings to look old and tarnished after only 1 year. Also, stainless steel just looks 
			nicer than the galvanized products that most hardware stores sell.
			</p>
			<p>Each footing is comprised of 250lbs. of steel reinforced concrete. Each footing is exposed 6 inches above ground 
			and 12 inches underground. I used 3.5 inch stainless steel flat bars, embedded in the concrete, to hold each post in place.
			Seven of them were 316L and one was 304 just for fun. Each screw hole was hand drilled with a corded handheld 950rpm 
			power drill. If you've ever tried to drill in hard metals by hand, you know exactly how hard it is to do it accurately. 
			But I got very good at it in a hurry. I am proud to say that except for the first two, every hole was within 1mm of its 
			target. By the time I worked on the final flat bar, all of those holes were within 1/2mm of their target. I used cobalt steel 
			drill bits that are used for aircraft manufacturing and they cut through stainless steel like butter. Each flat bar ended up 
			with a matte finish that was just shy of mirror. I went against a mirror finish because finger prints and smudges were too 
			visible.</p>
			</div>

	<div class="main4 break">
			<div class="description subsecmain">
			<h3>Passivation</h3>
			<p>A few weeks after completing 3 of the footings I noticed that a few of the embedded flat bars started showings signs of rust. 
			And one of them in particular had some large dark blotch stains. Obviously, they had been 
			contaminated by my supplier when they were cut to my desired length. Also, in the process of lapping the flat bars, I may 
			have removed the passive film that protects stainless steel from further oxidation. Stainless steel is different from normal
			carbon steel because it contains about 11% chromium. This chromium forms a passive film of chromium oxide, which helps prevent 
			further surface corrosion and blocks corrosion from spreading into the steel's internal structure. Solution? Passivation.</p>
			<p>ASTM A380 defines passivation as "“the removal of exogenous iron or iron compounds from the surface of a stainless steel 
			by means of a chemical dissolution, most typically by a treatment with an acid solution that will remove the surface 
			contamination but will not significantly affect the stainless steel itself.” Although nitric acid is typically used in the process,
			using such a toxic chemical was not an option in my backyard. In my case, I only used citric acid and the 
			results were exactly what I needed. Rust and the blotches that I was seeing never materialized again.</p>

			<h3>Spar Varnish + Canvas</h3>
			<p>I used four 8ft Douglas-fir posts, two 10ft. x 5in. pieces of redwood, and two 8ft. x 5in. redwood pieces. Each of one 
			is protected from the elements by two coats of UV sealer and six coats of spar varnish. The application of the spar varnish 
			was the most time consuming process. Each coat had to be very thin and I had to wait a few days for each coat to fully cure. 
			I hope that this process will last about 5 years before I have to do any kind of maintenance on the wood.</p>
			<p>I chose canvas for the first version because it was cheap (about $30) but I never expected them to last long. To secure the canvas, I used parts that were specifically made for sale boats because they were the most cost 
			effective stainless steel (SS) parts I could find. I used SS 2-3/8" carabiners and 5/16" SS folding pad eyes that have 
			a safe working load of 7,000 lbs! For the canvas I used SS grommets. This makes the canvas very easy to remove. It only 
			takes about 5 minutes to remove it. So far the canvas is already suffering from decay. I hope to make other versions that 
			are made out of more durable materials.</p>

			<h3>What's left?</h3>
			<p>For the most part, this project is done. The finish on the wood and the stainless steel are both still flawless. The only 
			issue so far is the canvas. Many of the pieces didn't do very well during this past season's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Ana_winds">Santa Ana winds</a>. 
			They have started to tear around the grommets. I am currently looking at other materials that would be more durable for 
			this situation. I also plan to use techniques that are used on sails in order to prevent any tears in the fabric. I am 
			looking for something that is durable and rot proof.</p>
